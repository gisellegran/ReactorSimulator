####Species
    for each species: (or just the name & phase if were limitting to the listed ones)
    name, phase, molarMass, HeatCapacotyCoeffs,

####Reaction (For powerrate law)
    rate type (POWERLAW,..)
    rate constant A/Ea
    Reference enthalpy (kJ/mol...)/ reference temperature (K or C)
    for each species:
    Species name, stpichiometric coefficient, order
    --- - repeat for each reaction

###Stream Input
T(K or C)
P(atm or kPa ...)
Viscosity
Stream Composition (molar flows or totalMolarFlow + molFractions)

###Reactor
    Type (PBR of PFR)
    Pressure Drop (ISOBARIC or ERGUN)
        if ergun, catalyst details must be given
    Heat Transfer (ISOTHERMAL, ADIABATIC, COCURRENT, COUNTERCURRENT)
    if PBR:
        Volume (L or m3 or..)
    if PFR:
        Weight (kg, g or..)


##Catalyst
    density (what units)
    ....
